This project was created for a web design class with group collaboration from the Business Administration class.

**Note**: It seems a while ago I added a folder to test the site when moving it from my old GitHub account to my new one. As a result, the index.html file was no longer at the root of the site. So in oder to avoid issues, I created a new index.html that redirects to the old one. This change is taking a while to update with GitHub Pages (unless there's another issue it's not working). Sorry if you can't see the site. I'll have to debug later.
